# JobInterviewGuide_Workshop

This repository contains the **Job Interview Guide Workshop Notebook** designed to help Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist candidates prepare for technical interviews through practical exercises and quiz-based reflection.

---

## 📘 Overview

The notebook, `JobInterviewGuide_Workshop.ipynb`, combines **an interactive quiz transcript** and **hands-on machine learning exercises**.  
It focuses on **model evaluation**, **regression metrics**, and **validation workflows** used in real ML interviews.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

1. **Regression Metrics**
   - Compute and interpret MAE, MSE, RMSE.
   - Understand why MAE is more robust to outliers.
2. **R² and Model Evaluation**
   - Compute R² manually and using scikit-learn.
   - Compare model performance against a baseline.
3. **Train/Validation/Test Workflow**
   - Learn proper data splitting for unbiased evaluation.
   - Use validation data for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Polynomial Regression & Overfitting**
   - Observe how model complexity affects bias and variance.
5. **Cross-Validation**
   - Perform 10-fold CV and interpret the mean and standard deviation of MAE.
6. **Practical Code Exercises**
   - Implement and analyze regression performance using Python and scikit-learn.
